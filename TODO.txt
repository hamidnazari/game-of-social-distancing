[ ] Put grid and agents in their own pixi containers
    const grid = new PIXI.Container();
    const agents = new PIXI.Container();
    pixi.stage.addChild(grid);

[ ] Add immunity?
    - Agents are either vaccinated
    - Agents become immune after recovering for the first time
    - Immunity brings chance of getting infected by X%
[/] Simple smoke test:
        Input:
            - Density Rate: %20
            - Initial Infected Rate: %1
            - Transmission Rate: %80
            - Recoverability Rate: %50
            - Infection Period: 15
            - Speed Modifier: 10
            - Random Seed: CoViD-19
        Output:
            - Initial People Count: 2101
            - Alive Count: 1031
            - Healthy Count: 1031
            - Infected Count: 0
            - Recently Died Count: 0
            - Buried Count: 1070
            - Day Number: 510
